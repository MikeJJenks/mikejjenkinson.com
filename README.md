## Overview

This repository contains the source code for my personal page located at http://www.mikejjenkinson.com. The page is written using the Python Flask library. The application serves each of the individual pages, in particular the [listening](http://www.mikejjenkinson.com/listening) page which pulls and displays the summarized output of my [Spotter application](https://github.com/MikeJJenks/spotter) detailing my most recent up-to-date Spotify listening history. The Flask application is deployed on a cloud-based virtual machine using Gunicorn and Nginx.
